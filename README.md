# Distributed AI Runtime

## Project Highlights
✅ Complete C++17 distributed tensor operations system  
✅ ThreadPool-based concurrent execution  
✅ Fault-tolerant networking with dead socket removal  
✅ Disk-backed checkpointing (KVStore)  
✅ Neural execution graph with parallel node execution  
✅ TCP-based tensor broadcasting  
✅ Task scheduling system

## Overview
A C++ distributed AI runtime prototype supporting:
- Multi-node tensor broadcast
- Thread-pool task scheduling
- Disk-backed checkpointing
- Minimal neural execution graph

This project demonstrates distributed systems engineering, concurrency, and ML infrastructure in a single, internship-ready repository.
